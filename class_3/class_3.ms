Suppose I have the following sample data:

4.8, 0.2, 2.2, 3.5
.EN
.LP
I've used R to find that the lower quartile is \fB0.45\fP, the upper quartile is 3.575, and the IQR is $3.575 - 0.45 = 3.125$

3.575, and the IQR is $3.575 - 0.45 = 3.125$

NOTE: Sometimes outliers are actually an error

.LP
Data outside $[0.45 - (1.5)(3.125), 3.575 - (1.5)(3.125)] = [-4.2375, 8.2625]$ Would be an \fBOutlier\fP.

$8.8$ which is outside that range.
The right whisker ends at $5.0$ (our largest non-outlier),

The Outlier 8.8 is indicated with a circle.

For a scatterplot to be appropriate, each pair of measure-

.SH
Example

.LP
I select 20 people, and for each person, I record \fBx\fP, their age, and \fBy\fP, their maximum heart rate.

Here, the data is \fBclearly bivariate\fP (one sample of size n = 20, with pairs
of measurements being made);

A scatterplot would be appropriate.

.SH
Example
.LP
I select 20 people and put them on Diet A, and measure x,
their blood pressure after two weeks. I select another 20 people and put
them on Diet B, and measure y, their blood pressure after two weeks.

Here, we have two samples, of sizes n 1 = 20 and n 2 = 20. The data is
\fBnot bivariate\fP;

a scatterplot would be inappropriate.

Several of a particular species of fish are grown from eggs in
tanks set at particular temperatures. After a fixed number of days, all fish are measured.

Example: For our fish data:
.LP
We find $ sum from i=1 to n x sub  i y sub i = (19.5)(3900) + ... + (22.5)(5140) = 778165$.

Then, we find $x bar , y bar , s sub x , s sub y$ using our calculator.
We have r \[~=] 0.973.

NOTE: This is fairly linear
.SH
Interpretation
.LP
$r$ takes on values \fBbetween -1 and 1\fP. \fI no units \fP

.IP - 2
An $r$ value of -1 indicates a perfect \fBdecreasing linear\fP  relationship.
.IP - 2
An $r$ value of 1 indicates a perfect \fBincreasing linear\fP  relationship.
.IP - 2
An $r$ value of 0 indicates a \fBnon linear\fP relationship.

\f[B]Warning\f[] An $r$ value of 0 does not mean there is no relationship, only
that the relationship is not linear.

Correlation Vs Causation

.LP
When we examine variables x and y and find there appears to be some correlation between them, there are many possible explanations:
.IP \[bu] 2
x causes y
.IP \[bu] 2
y causes x
.IP \[bu] 2
There is some other unexplored variable which relates to both x and y
.IP \[bu] 2
The correlation is spurious (thereâ€™s no actual relationship; the correlation is just a coincidence)

NOTE. Spurious = no real correlation

.SH
Example
.LP
The image below shows that there appears to be a strong correlation between the divorce rate in Maine and the consumption of margarine.
This is one of many examples of spurious correlation.

Example
.LP
Consider the experiment where we flip a coin three times and
note the sequence of heads and tails.

For this experiment the sample space is as follows:

$S = left { HHH, HHT, HT H, HT T, T HH, T HT, T T H, T T T right } $

Each of these eight elements of S are sample points.
Some examples of events are:

$A = left { HHH, HHT, HT H, T HH right }$ \[<-] at least 2 heads

$B = left { HHT, HT T, T HT, T T T right }$

$C = left { HHH, T T T right }$

Events are usually described in words. For example, B is the event that the third flip is tails

We say that an event \fBoccurs\fP if one of its sample points is an observedwhen we carry out the experiment when we carry out the experiment.
