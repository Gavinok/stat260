Descriptive Statistics

organize, summarize, display, and describe features of the data.

Example
.LP
Some sorts of questions descriptive statistics answers:
.IP \[bu] 2
What is the greatest tensile strength recorded? What is the range of recorded tensile strengths?
.IP \[bu] 2
What proportion of the sample of voters is older than 65?
.IP \[bu] 2
What is the average weight of the sample of people taking blood

pressure medication? How spread out are the measurements for resting heart rate?

draw conclusions about the population based on the measurements from the sample.

Suppose we have the sample data: 6, 9, 3, 18, 11. Find the sample median of these data.
